# Readme for Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This collection of notebooks demonstrates various applications of machine learning techniques, ranging from generative models to classification tasks. Each project utilizes different datasets and approaches, providing a comprehensive insight into the capabilities of machine learning.

## Projects Overview

### 1. [Conditional_GAN](https://github.com/mmdrez4/ML-From-Scratch/blob/main/Conditional_GAN.ipynb)
This notebook implements a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The process begins with training an autoencoder to extract features from input images. These features, combined with noise, are then fed into a convolutional network to generate new images. A convolutional network is also employed as the discriminator to differentiate between real and generated images.

### 2. [Image_Captioning](https://github.com/mmdrez4/ML-From-Scratch/blob/main/Image_Captioning.ipynb)
This project focuses on developing an intelligent agent that writes captions for images. Utilizing the COCO dataset, known for its large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning capabilities, the model learns to analyze images and generate appropriate captions.

### 3. [Classification with Transfer Learning](https://github.com/mmdrez4/ML-From-Scratch/blob/main/Classification_with_Transfer_Learning.ipynb)
In this task, the Inception V3 model is trained using PyTorch and transfer learning techniques to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of applying pre-trained models to specific classification tasks.

### 4. [Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/mmdrez4/ML-From-Scratch/blob/main/Classification_with_Convolutional Neural_Networks.ipynb)
This project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset. The focus is on building and training a CNN from scratch to understand the intricacies of convolutional layers in image classification.

### 5. [Classification with Fully Connected Model](https://github.com/mmdrez4/ML-From-Scratch/blob/main/Classification_with_Fully_Connected_Model.ipynb)
Here, a fully-connected neural network model is trained using PyTorch to classify images from the MNIST dataset. This project highlights the basics of neural network architecture and its application to digit classification tasks.
